#   Todos:
#       *-   change NO_WEB to WEB
#       -   updated DataSets: in Store DaBoStore: has the same value than Counter: in commons. thats funny. Is that correct, could that be done simpler?
#       *-   FORMAT in Commons should be renamed to CSV_FORMAT and should be omitted, what means that no csv is written, independently from CSV_MODE.
#       *-   CSV_MODE: "NONE" should be omitted, whats the same as "NONE"
#       -   adding YML_FORMAT to Commons which also can be omitted. The YML-Files becomes the same function as the old xml-files in PHP. 
#           YML_FORMAT has the option CUMULATE or SINGLE. can be omitted.
#           !!! added this but e.g. same "uptime" comes 4 times when CUMULATE is set. why is in System.yml "CPU Infos: '- - - - >'" and some more 
#       -   adding YML_MODE with the same options as CSV_Mode
#       -   MERGE should be changed to - [MERGE_TIME, get, [STORE, SHELF, BOX], [STORE, SHELF, BOX]] or something like that. 
#           With this change we can access any value in any Datastore from any other Datastores and we can set separate times for any Merge
#   
#       - es gibt  eine Möglichkeit dictionarys mit einer Funktion/Methode auszustatten die Verwendet wird wenn ein Key nicht vorhanden ist
#	      ueber die Verwendung von collections.defaultdict nachdenken

# for each signal from DBC file or self generated data its necessary to define a Store here with the keys:
#   _Common_keys_and_values_
#   CSV_FORMAT:
#       MULTI:
#           csv-file with all declared values in one file
#           file name: <StoreName>-<date>__<time>
#       SINGLE:
#           cvs-file(s), each for every declared value
#           file name: <StoreName>_<ShelfName>_<MODE>-<date>__<time>
#   MERGE:
#       Datastores with 'MERGE' are virtual Stores. 
#       They dont receive Data from anywhere, they fetch data from sources in the list below 'MERGE'
#           syntax: [operation, DataShelf in this Store, Store to merge with, Shelf in that Store, DataBox in that Shelf]
#           operation can be:
#           'get': get value from elsewhere and put it into thes shelf
#           'and': get bool values from the list of variables, do 'and'-function and put in the shelf
#           'or': get bool values from the list of variables, do 'or'-function and put in the shelf
#           'add': get values from the list of variables, do 'add'-function and put in the shelf
#       !!! They have no associated real sending device !!!
#       !!! consider they must be build _after all other_ (real) stores are build !!!
#   FILLED_UP:  
#       a Flag, if defined CSV_FORMATCSV-files have no empty columns (like ',,'). These gap(s) are filled with the latest known value(s)
#       otherwise (if not defined) there are gap(s) if no current value is available
#   RELOAD_TIMEOUT:
#       the reload count value to check if the Store is still alive 
#       can be omitted
#   TIMEOUT:
#       the current timeout value. 
#
#   _keys and values for each DataShelf_
#   RELOAD_CNT:
#       the reload count value for MODE = COUNT and MODE = AVR
#       can be omitted for other modes
#   CNT:
#       the current count value. 
#   MODES: 
#      NONE: 
#         dont care for this signal
#      CHANGE:
#           only value changes are stored, just to save space 
#      COUNT:
#          count RELOAD_CNT values and than store one, just to save space
#      AVR:
#          average calculation with RELOAD_CNT values
#      ALL:
#           saving everything
#   MIN:
#       Min value for this signal, if not used set it i.e. to 0 or any other numeric value
#   MAX:
#       Max value for this signal, if not used set it i.e. to 0 or any other numeric value
#   CURRENT_IN_RANGE:
#       the signal is within MIN and MAX
#       MIN, MAX and IN_RANGE can be omitted if not used
#   AVR_IN_RANGE:
#       same as CURRENT_IN_RANGE but checked against the AVR value(s)
#   DECIMALS:
#       number of digits after comma (for float)
#
#   RRD_DB:
#       this defines the RRDTool-Database in the input data for it. The syntax is:
#            RRD_DB:
#                - [[OUTFILE, <"CONST">, <"Name_of_the_RRD-file">],
#                   [<§DataStore> or <"SELF">, <§DataShelf>, <"Name_of_the_desired_DataBox">],
#                   [<§DataStore> or <"SELF">, <§DataShelf, <"Name_of_the_desired_DataBox">],
#                   ... repeat theses lines as much as the rrd-file needs
#                   [INFILE, CONST, 'OutTemp.txt']]
#       
#       the first line has to be the output file definition starting with "OUTFILE". The second value is the DataShelf from where
#       a value is taken or "CONST". The third value is the file name. The system uses this name as a Prefix and appends the Hostname of the device to make a unique filename.
#       References to other Stores or shelfs starting with "§". For values from the DataStore where the RRD_DB-definition is defined use "SELF" otherwise use §<DataStoreName>.
#       If there are less values then the RRD-File is build for use lines like "[SELF, CONST, '0']". This fills up the RRD-data with "0". Instead of <§DataSore> or <"SELF"> "INFILE"
#       is allowed to define a file from which a value is taken. The file should contain only a string that represents the value.
#       
#   structure of a Storedefinition:
#   <StoreName>: (with the following StoreShelf')
#           Commons:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_1>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_2>:

#           <shelf_3>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           ...
#   'Commons' is a ShelfName wich every Store must have.
